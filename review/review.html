    <h2>Apple Watch Series 2 review: work it out</h2> 
<p class="review">The Apple Watch Series 2 is exactly that. It’s what Apple had resisted calling its wearable for the past year and a half, even declining to categorize it as such when citing industry rankings, opting for the “smartwatch” category instead. It is, definitely, still a smartwatch. But the Watch now has focus, and that’s a good thing. </p>
    
    <h3><b>Old and new</b></h3>

<p>The Apple Watch Series 2 comes in three models: the least expensive aluminum model that starts at $369; the stainless steel model that starts at $549; and a ceramic model that starts at $1,249. There’s also a Nike-branded version of the sport watch that will ship in late October. All of these watches have the same internals, just different external materials.</p>
